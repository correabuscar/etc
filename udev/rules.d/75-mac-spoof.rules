# ^ shows lots more, like: ID_MODEL_ID=0x8136 which we can't seem to be able to match on!

#^ obvious fake MAC
#XXX: must run it twice otherwise the prev. one will be shown as "permanent mac" when "ip addr" is issued! clever! discovered on 01july2020; ok that only works for reboots. Maybe it needs a different mac to allow it? nope, no effect; permaddr is still listed! so after first reboot it lists the last set MAC as permaddr! and after second reboot it doesn't list it at all possibly because it wasn't set to a different one this time! indeed, so, I'd need to do two reboots! TODO: find out how this works and why this happens! true only on Z575!
