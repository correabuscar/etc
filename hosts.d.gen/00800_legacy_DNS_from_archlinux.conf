##manual dns via dns.google.com
##eg. https://dns.google.com/query?name=dns.google.com&type=A&dnssec=true
##^ that's user friendly one!

##The following reported by https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/?&domain=dns.google.com&typ=A via us proxy
##74.125.141.102 dns.google.com
##dns.google.com 74.125.141.101
##dns.google.com 74.125.141.138
##dns.google.com 74.125.141.139
##dns.google.com 74.125.141.100
##dns.google.com 74.125.141.113
##This reported by my `dig dns.google.com`:
##172.217.16.110 dns.google.com
##XXX: no /etc/hosts entry required for 'dig' anymore! due to using 'curl --resolve ...'
##8.8.8.8 dns1
##8.8.4.4 dns2
9.9.9.9 quad9 dns3 dns.quad9.net
##XXX: using same name for multiple lines is only supported by dnsmasq! so then they will be rotated only when using dnsmasq, eg. when 'ping dns'  is called multiple times on cmdline. XXX chromium also uses the multiple entries from here!!
##^ probably depends on /etc/hosts.conf multi on/off option!
1.1.1.1 cfdns cfdns1 dns dns1
1.0.0.1 cfdns2 dns2
