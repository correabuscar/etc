#XXX: disabled 'debug' (28 dec 2015)
#>=dev-lang/rust-1.3.0 -clang -debug doc -libcxx
>=dev-lang/rust-1.43.0 -debug doc -libcxx clippy nightly miri parallel-compiler system-llvm system-bootstrap rustfmt rust-src rust-analyzer llvm_targets_ARM llvm_targets_AArch64 llvm_targets_WebAssembly
#adding llvm_targets_WebAssembly too, just in case, 28 march 2024
#added llvm_targets_ARM on 28 march 2024, not good enough we need 64bit arm aka: llvm_targets_AArch64
#rust-analyzer added as an option to rust on 11 Nov 2022 (or few days earlier) so I don't have to use my own git clone.
#rls flag got removed from source on at least(or priorly) rust version 1.67.0 but was present in 1.65.0, 07feb2023, rust-analyzer is left, and possibly the intended replacement for rls
#rls flag needs rust-src, added 08feb2022
#doneTODO: maybe disable 'debug' again?
#removed 'doc' for now, 29nov2020 - it is currently -doc due to not compiling anyway!
#added 'doc' on 08feb2024

#sys-devel/llvm doc
#adding "doc" to hopefully fix this:
#$ rustc -C target-cpu=help
#Target CPU help is not supported by this LLVM version.
#nope it's not 'doc' that affects that! made patch: make_target_cpus_work_llvmside_68e1e29618b_2.patch for llvm and another one for rust named 0100_make_target_cpus_work_rustside.patch

#USE=system-bootstrap means Gentoo will use prev version ie. 1.47.0 if you want 1.48.0 rust to install; to compile rust! instead of allowing rust build to fetch a binary during build! So, a rust-bin package will be emerged priorly.
