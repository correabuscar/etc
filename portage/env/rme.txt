#       /etc/portage/env/
#              In this directory additional package-specific bashrc files can be created.  Note that  if  package-spe‐
#              cific environment variable settings are all that’s needed, then /etc/portage/package.env should be used
#              instead  of  the  bashrc approach that is described here. Also note that special variables such as FEA‐
#              TURES and INSTALL_MASK will not produce the intended results if they are set in bashrc,  and  therefore
#              /etc/portage/package.env  should  be  used  instead. Lastly, note that these files are interpreted much
#              later than the portage environment file package.env.
#
#              Portage will source all of these bashrc files after /etc/portage/bashrc in the following order:
#
#              1. /etc/portage/env/${CATEGORY}/${PN}
#
#              2. /etc/portage/env/${CATEGORY}/${PN}:${SLOT}
#
#              3. /etc/portage/env/${CATEGORY}/${P}
#
#              4. /etc/portage/env/${CATEGORY}/${PF}


#So I made any *.conf files in these subdirs or root here, should be
# referenced by /etc/portage/package.env/package.env.ALL
#else they shouldn't be .conf, and thus will be used as bashrc env.vars. like
#during build instead of during portage package processing like *.conf are
#
#so anything with *.conf is already in /etc/portage/package.env/package.env.ALL
#(unless u forgot to add them)
#therefore each of its vars is exported eg. declare -x
#otherwise, non-.conf files have their vars set but not exported ie. declare --
#
#so never use non-.conf files! 30March2024
