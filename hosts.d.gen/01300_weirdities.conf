##XXX: well, I'll be... these are valid: (can ping them!)
##127.1.1.1 .
##127.1.1.2 ..
##127.1.1.3 :
##XXX:but this isn't valid:
##127.1.1.4 (null)
##//XXX: here's a way to obscure an IP as a hostname: $ ping ::ffff:1.1.1.1
##will ping 1.1.1.1 !
##XXX: well ok, it only works for ping i guess, this won't work: $ wget http://::ffff:127.1.1.99/someshie
##http://::ffff:127.1.1.99/someshie: Invalid host name.
##XXX: the following still resolves to 127.0.0.2 instead of 127.0.0.1 (righfully so):
##127.0.0.1 ::ffff:127.0.0.2
##XXX: but this non-ffff will fail to be resolved(eg. by ping-ing):
##127.0.0.1 ::abcd:127.0.0.2
##ping: ::abcd:127.0.0.2: Address family for hostname not supported
##same:
##127.0.0.1 ::f:127.0.0.2
##XXX: well these work as seen:
##127.0.0.1 ::g:127.0.0.2
##127.0.0.1 :::127.0.0.2
##The following (and that's U+1D675 , not F!):
##127.0.0.1 ::𝙵𝙵𝙵𝙵a:127.1.1.2
##reduces(internally) to this:
##127.0.0.1 ::fffFa:127.1.1.2
##^ so that line ONLY must be defined here!
##127.0.0.1 ::abcde:127.0.0.2
##XXX: the following resolve to 127.1.1.2 not 127.0.0.1 like the above do !!! because they get transformed into ffff (the normal f!)
##𝙵	U+1D675	Mathematical Monospace Capital F   (this looks like normal F)
