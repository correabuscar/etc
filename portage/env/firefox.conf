#it ooms, only when updating @world, with -j18 in cc1plus process! but not when ran alone as # emerge -av firefox  ;; probably because /var/tmp/portage is using too much space and since it's in zram it's using more RAM than when running the emerge -av firefox alone! this is true when 32G RAM!
#MAKEOPTS="${MAKEOPTS} -j12"
#^ not yet tested ^
#64G RAM now:
MAKEOPTS="${MAKEOPTS} -j18"

#'hardened' use flag already sets this to =3 but it does it before our =2 somehow, so, we try this:
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
FCFLAGS="${FCFLAGS} -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
FFLAGS="${FFLAGS} -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3"
