##blocked by uMatrix and uBlock:  (this actually prevents youtube history from working - videos are not added to it, even tho it's unpaused!) But remember you have to whitelist the entire host not just images in uMatrix, for this to work!
#0.0.0.0 s.youtube.com  #Only makes sense when you're logged into youtube! then you can comment out!
##^ might as well block it, since uBlock was blocking it anyway (uMatrix wasn't, by my manually set choice)
##^ Re-blocked due to not using youtube.
##^ unblocked since using youtube, 12 march 2023 and earlier!

##this one seems to be ok to block:
0.0.0.0 gg.google.com
##following line is needed for youtube-dl  the entire channel; on linux!
#0.0.0.0 gdata.youtube.com
#0.0.0.0 youtube-nocookie.com
##^ unblocked since using youtube, 12 march 2023 and earlier! allowing these just in case.
