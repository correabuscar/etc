#doneFIXME: ok setting these won't work because nf_conntrack is a module that's loaded later than systemd sysctl is trying to apply these! confirmed working when CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK=y instead of =m !

#XXX ^ kernel/sysctl_binary.c commented it out saying "no longer used", so it probably had no effect!

#default 60
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_close_wait=10
#^ has no effect, still takes 60-61 seconds, probably because kernel/sysctl_binary.c has commented it out saying "no longer used", so sysctl fails when trying to set it by "systemd-sysctl[252]: Couldn't write '10' to 'net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_close_wait', ignoring: No such file or directory" however the file exists in /proc and is setable, it has no effect (according to netstat -pantuWc , TIME_WAIT is still 60 seconds after setting to 1) echo '1' |sudo tee /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_close_wait and it's verified 'cat' to still be '1' but according to net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_tcp.c this should still work! XXX: ok looks like this fails(with that "ignoring" message) because nf_conntrack is a module that's not loaded when systemd tried to apply these sysctl settings! fixed by CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK=y however this timeout value is still ignored, so it's 60 sec instead of the set 10!
