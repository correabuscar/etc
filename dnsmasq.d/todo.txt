use this to allow entries to be queried by using '#'
The   special  server  address  '#'  means,  "use  the  standard
              servers",            so             --server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
              --server=/www.google.com/# will send queries for *.google.com to
              1.2.3.4, except  *www.google.com  which  will  be  forwarded  as
              usual.

thus find a way to block everything[1]/ "server=/./" [2] ? and then use the above '#' method as whitelist to allow only certain hosts to be queried, hmm... maybe also keep the blacklist because well:
More  specific  domains  take  precedence over less specific do‚Äê
              mains,             so:              --server=/google.com/1.2.3.4
              --server=/www.google.com/2.3.4.5    will    send   queries   for
              *.google.com to 1.2.3.4, except *www.google.com, which  will  go
              to 2.3.4.5

from man 8 dnsmasq
[1] see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/99169/dnsmasq-white-list-for-specific-clients-on-network/99173#99173
so by not specifying server=IPhere and thus only using server=/hostnamehere/IPhere  where IPhere is dns server IP on the inet, and hostnamehere is whitelisted host, can achieve whitelisting.

[2] that server=/./  thing has no blocking effect, at least not when server=IPhere is used.
