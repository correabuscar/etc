#second try:
#disabled: pulseaudio realtime
#enabled: s3tc
#audio works (also enabled EAX in winecfg btw)

#third try: let's disable staging which requires removal of s3tc too! (this seems to have worked with the hiccups!)

#//nope, can't disable: fourth try: disabled: threads

#fourth try, because hiccups seem to be back!!, added(enabled): mono mp3 openal opencl osmesa staging s3tc
#NOTE: mono was not needed!
#not opencl and osmesa which cause llvm rebuilds(at least!) which I don't want to do right now!

#XXX: OH WAIT, it's the full duplex of audio that causes hiccups!!! select: Audio Stereo Output instead of Audio Stereo Duplex!!

#thus, re-enabling: staging and s3tc in fourth try above!!

#fifth try(works but out of adapter memory is annoying): disabling: staging s3tc

# 6th try enabling staging and s3tc again (ooam still occurrs with them disabled! or only when they're disabled?)
# ok now it doesn't freeze/crash anymore! (with EAX and the other one for gfx improv. perf. set in winecfg too!)
