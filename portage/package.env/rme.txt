#              package.env
#                     Per-package environment variable settings. Entries refer to environment files that are placed in
#                     the /etc/portage/env/ directory and have the same format as make.conf(5). Note that these  files
#                     are  interpreted  much  earlier  than the package-specific bashrc files which are described in a
#                     later section about /etc/portage/env/.  Beginners should be careful to recognize the  difference
#                     between  these  two  types  of  files. When environment variable settings are all thatâ€™s needed,
#                     package.env is the recommended approach to use.
#
#                     Format:
#                     - comment lines begin with # (no inline comments)
#                     - one DEPEND atom per line followed by name(s) of environment file(s)
#
#                     Example:
#                     # use environment variables from /etc/portage/env/glibc.conf for the glibc package
#                     sys-libs/glibc glibc.conf
