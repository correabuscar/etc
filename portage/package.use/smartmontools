#* WARNING: There's already a drive database in '//var/db/smartmontools'!
# * Because we cannot determine if this database is untouched
# * or was modified by the user you have to manually update the
# * drive database:
# * 
# * a) Replace '//var/db/smartmontools/drivedb.h' by the database shipped with this
# *    release which can be found in '//usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h', i.e.
# * 
# *      cp "//usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h" "//var/db/smartmontools"
# * 
# * b) Run the following command as root:
# * 
# *      /usr/sbin/update-smart-drivedb
# * 
# * However, 'update-smart-drivedb' requires that you re-emerge smartmontools
# * with USE='update_drivedb'.
