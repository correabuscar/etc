# /etc/inputrc: initialization file for readline
#
# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#
# Quick dirty little note:
#  To get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  While running bash, hit CTRL+V, and then type the key sequence.
#  So, typing 'ALT + left arrow' in Konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  The readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word
#
# Customization note:
#  You don't need to put all your changes in this file.  You can create
#  ~/.inputrc which starts off with the line:
#    $include /etc/inputrc
#  Then put all your own stuff after that.

set enable-bracketed-paste on
#^ You can enable bracketed paste mode in bash-4.4 and later by putting that in your inputrc src: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00079.html
