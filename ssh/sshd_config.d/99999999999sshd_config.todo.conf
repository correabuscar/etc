#AuthenticationMethods keyboard-interactive:pam
#PasswordAuthentication no
# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,
# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will
# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,
# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass
# the setting of "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
#UsePAM yes
UsePAM no
#^ set PAM to no, because PAM is not used if public key authentication is used! src: https://dev.gentoo.org/~swift/docs/security_benchmarks/openssh.html#item-xccdf_org.gentoo.dev.swift_group_config-default
#okno: but if PAM is no, then limits.conf is not applied! but keep these 2 as 'no' to disable PAM auth PasswordAuthentication ChallengeResponseAuthentication; OK, that wasn't it, XXX: even with UsePAM no, ulimit -c works, set to unlimited as per limits.conf except in the case when you use '*' instead of '0:' as first field in there! tested!

# Change to no to disable s/key passwords
#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
#^ yes = enables TIS Challenge/Response in SSH protocol version 1, and keyboard-interactive in SSH protocol v2
