sys-apps/smartmontools minimal -update_drivedb -update-drivedb -daemon
#needs "-daemon" to avoid making a /var/db/smartmontools/drivedb.h which would override any patches for drivedb.h in the source. Daemon is smartd but wasn't used before: rc-service smartd start
#don't use "update-drivedb" because it needs running a sh script as root to fetch file from upstream, which is thus less secure than not using it at all, keep embedded drivedb.h instead! note that it will ignore /usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h apparently! so a rebuild is needed when change in that file is needed.

#* WARNING: There's already a drive database in '//var/db/smartmontools'!
# * Because we cannot determine if this database is untouched
# * or was modified by the user you have to manually update the
# * drive database:
# * 
# * a) Replace '//var/db/smartmontools/drivedb.h' by the database shipped with this
# *    release which can be found in '//usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h', i.e.
# * 
# *      cp "//usr/share/smartmontools/drivedb.h" "//var/db/smartmontools"
# * 
# * b) Run the following command as root:
# * 
# *      /usr/sbin/update-smart-drivedb
# * 
# * However, 'update-smart-drivedb' requires that you re-emerge smartmontools
# * with USE='update_drivedb'.
