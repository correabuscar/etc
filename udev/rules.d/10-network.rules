# test this ^ with: udevadm test-builtin net_setup_link /sys/class/net/net0
# it only shows ID_NET_DRIVER=r8169 whereas this:

# ^ shows lots more, like: ID_MODEL_ID=0x8136 which we can't seem to be able to match on!

# "Note: When choosing the static names it should be avoided to use names in the format of "ethX" and "wlanX", because this may lead to race conditions between the kernel and udev during boot. Instead, it is better to use interface names that are not used by the kernel as default, e.g.: net0, net1, wifi0, wifi1"
