#TODO: unlock this ^

#FIXME: the following 3 lines in qterminal's Gentoo are cutting some of the last char on EOL vertically. See why! Depends on installed fonts which make the f00 show up as it does.
#127.0.1.1	z5.localdomain z5 f00 𝙵𝟢𝟢 𝙵ⲞⲞ
#ping: 𝙵ⲞⲞ: Parameter string not correctly encoded
#ping: 𝙵𝟢𝟢: Temporary failure in name resolution
#^ unless I add 'f00' which '𝙵𝟢𝟢' gets reduced to! (possibly due to something like firefox-hg/intl/icu/source/data/unidata/confusables.txt:2172 )
#note: 𝙵𝟢𝟢 doesn't need to be added! ornot!//but adding it for grep-ing purposes, I suppose!
