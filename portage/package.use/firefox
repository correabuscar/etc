#added 'eme-free' for 'ac_add_options --disable-eme' (old mozconfig) on 29nov2020
#with debug it fails on startup with this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=994859
#With USE=-clang aka gcc/g++ you have to remove -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks from CXXFLAGS as per https://bugs.gentoo.org/751787#c25 or else firefox fails to compile Span.h error: '((& arr[0]) != 0)' is not a constant expression
#added lto and pgo to USE on 28 nov 2020, unsure if they compile or not! using clang too!
#removed pgo on 29nov2020 it takes too long and barely uses CPU, need some inet (but it's blocked)
#enabled USE=wayland on 31 oct 2022
#disabled wayland globally, so removed from here, on 07feb2023

#XXX: use -egl to CAN enable hwaccel in firefox (9fps vs 5fps without accel) this was with system-cairo and firefox 42.0 (not -r1)
#XXX: system-cairo makes it slower! 9fps with accel(5fps w/o)  versus 16fps without accel!

#XXX: with -egl -system-cairo 42.0-r1 is 5fps with hwaccel ! and 16fps without! (toggled from Preferences)

#Don't install the Cisco System openh264 plugin in firefox
media-libs/openh264 -plugin
#XXX: must put -openh264 for firefox package too! or else it will want "plugin" on this!
